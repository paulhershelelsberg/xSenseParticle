<h1>xSense Particle Connection </h1>
<p>This max patch uses javascript objects to send XML HTTP requests to the Particle API. Make sure to place the entire repository in the Max 7 directory found in your local documents folder. This patch reads muscle signals from an xSense module and posts Particle events with the incoming data.
